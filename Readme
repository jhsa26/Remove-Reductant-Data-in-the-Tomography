        The workflow for removing redundant data in the tomography

Step1: unzip ConvertSph.zip. then you use ConvertSph matlab codes to convert event lat lon depth into x,y,z. In this step, you should choose a reference point as an origion point and the angle of roatation like the parameters in terms of origin point in the tomoDD control parameters.

- You should prepare for a event.dat file, which can be extracted in the phase.dat
- You should change the parameters like the position (lat,lon) of origin point in the Convert_event.m file.
- the original codes of converting coordinate are available from https://github.com/jhsa26/ConvertSph2Car. this version is modified.

Step2: the event.car generated by Step1 and event.dat are the input files of Remove-Redundant-events.py

- There is a "Remove-Redundant-events.ipynb", which can be run interactively with jupyter. Usage: jupyter notebook Remove-Redundant-events.ipynb
- So you can run the codes in the each cell one by one. And the results will be showed in the frame after executing the cell 
- After selecting the events, you can use any shell scripts to select phase data from the origin phase data file. But in here, I provide a python
  script, a last cell in the Remmove-Redundant-events.ipynb. you should modify some parameters according to your requirments. 
- The difference between your phase data and the phase data in this example is that X, Y information are in the phase data of this example.
- If you want to run the cell to process the phase data. you should unzip the phase.zip into the current directiory.
